# App Inventor 3D Renderer
An app in MIT App Inventor that renders in 3D.
The server runs in Node.JS on a computer to do calculations and sends the resulting image to the phone to render.
If you want to see it faster, try the `tester/` project for a version written in Java AWT, or the `GoodVersion/` project for a version of the Android App written in Android Studio.
If you wish to see the app in MIT App Inventor, you can zip the contents of the `AI3DApp.aia/` directory and change the file extension from `.zip` to `.aia`, then import it into App Inventor at http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu
